Development Installation
------------------------

To install ckanext-tayside for development, activate your CKAN virtualenv and
do::

    git clone https://github.com/ViderumGlobal/ckanext-tayside.git
    cd ckanext-tayside
    python setup.py develop
    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt


----------
Modify CSS
----------

This extension uses LESS for styles. All changes must be made in one of the LESS
files located in the ``ckanext-tayside/ckanext/tayside/fanstatic/less`` folder.

In order to compile those files to CSS, the `less <https://www.npmjs.com/package/less>`_
npm module is used.

First make sure that you have installed `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_. That
will install the ``npm`` package manager. After that, open up the terminal and
change the current directory to ``ckanext-tayside/ckanext/tayside/fanstatic``.

Then run the following command that is going to install LESS::

    npm install less

After a successful installation, run the next command to compile the main less
file ``tayside.less`` to ``tayside.css``::

    ./node_modules/.bin/lessc less/tayside.less css/tayside.css

Every time there is some change in one of the less files, the upper command
needs to be run to compile those files to one css file.


-----------------
Running the Tests
-----------------

To run the tests, do::

    nosetests --nologcapture --with-pylons=test.ini

To run the tests and produce a coverage report, first make sure you have
coverage installed in your virtualenv (``pip install coverage``) then run::

    nosetests --nologcapture --with-pylons=test.ini --with-coverage --cover-package=ckanext.tayside --cover-inclusive --cover-erase --cover-tests
